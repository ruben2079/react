Frontend Developer Test
=============================================
Welcome to our Front-end Developer test.

In the following test we're gonna assert your skills building Web Frontend Applications.

We love over-engineering solutions, we want you to show off your best skills, and edge practices.


How it works
------------
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a new branch `dev`
3. Start coding.
4. Create a pull request to the `master` branch with your solution, please add a nice description to your pull request, and don't forget to include instructions for us to run your code.
5. Our in-house developers will review your code, at this point you shouldn't submit any new changes but interact in the code review process by replying to our reviewers questions.

Specifications
------------
- You need to create a beautiful interface, we want you to show us your styling skills. You can base it in our [Recipe Archive](https://www.goreadymade.com/recipe-archive)
- Write your solution with modern Frontend technologies and using JavaScript (No TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc).
- Use NPM.
- Use Webpack.
- Write unit tests.
- Do not use jQuery, Twitter's Bootstrap, Google's Material UI or any other CSS framework.
- Preferably write your test in `React`

Test
--------

In this test we will build a recipe review area.

It will contain two pages:

- [Login page](#login-page)
- [Recipe review page](#recipe-review-page)

#### Login page

Create a login page - A form with the e-mail and password field's - it should validate the format on the e-mail field and length of the password (over 6 characters). You don't need to write any kind of authentication so you can just mock it up.

#### Recipe review page

This will display all the recipes from our JSON object.

- The recipes have to be shown with all the data in the JSON displayed in a user-friendly way.
- Each recipe can be marked and unmarked as favorite - This logic should be written by you, do not use 3rd party libs.
- Recipes can be rated from 1 to 5 using the stars system - This logic should be written by you, do not use 3rd party libs.

Evaluation Criteria
